Using SourceForge's CVS for SmallBASIC
v1 - Nicholas Christopoulos, 3 Mar 2002

1. Setting up the CVS client
_______________________________________________________________________________

1.1. Unix
---------

1.1.1. Shell settings

=== tcsh:
setenv CVS_RSH ssh
setenv CVSROOT :ext:my_username@cvs.smallbasic.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/smallbasic
eval ssh-agent
echo my_password | ssh-add
=== EOF

=== bash:
export CVS_RSH=ssh
export CVSROOT=:ext:my_username@cvs.smallbasic.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/smallbasic
eval ssh-agent
echo my_password | ssh-add
=== EOF

1.1.2. Its easy if you type that in ~/.login (~/.profile for bash)

1.1.3. Before using cvs with source forge you need to do a once
	only login with:

	ssh my_username@sf.smallbasic.net

	This establishes your personal ssh account on the system.

1.2. Windows/DOS
----------------

1.2.1. DOS, Windows 9x/ME

	Download the djgpp packages from www.delorie.com.
	The DJGPP is a project which contains a lot of Unix programs for
	DOS 32-bit environment (32-bit memory manager is include, so it
	is working under real DOS or Win9x).

1.2.2. Windows NT/2000/XP

	Download the cygwin packages from www.cygwin.org
	The CygWin is a project which contains a lot of Unix programs for
	Win32 environment.

	Note: In both projects the tcsh is not working well, so, try the
	bash. Of course, bash/tcsh does not needed, you can do everything
	from command.com/cmd.exe, but, I am suggesting a bash because

	a) you can use large command-lines
	b) file-name replacements (bash replaces the filenames-wildcards
	(i.e. '*') with the real filenames, the cmd.exe just sends the
	characters as it is to the application).

1.2.3. The statement eval ssh-agent should be eval `ssh-agent`
	ssh-agent runs as a separate process under win98, as such
	the above only needs to be invoked once per session.

1.2.4. Before using ssh under cygwin you must first run
	ssh-user-config to setup user specific ssh key files in $HOME/.ssh

1.2.5. Before using cvs with source forge you need to do a once
	only login with:

	ssh my_username@sf.smallbasic.net

	This establishes your personal ssh account on the system.


2. Download the sources
_______________________________________________________________________________

I am suggesting the use of a generic directory for all the
CVS projects.

Example:
/usr/src/cvs

2.1. First we must in the parent directory of SB

	% cd /usr/src/cvs

2.2. We download the sources by using the 'co' parameter

	% cvs co SmallBASIC


3. Updating the SB (upload files)
_______________________________________________________________________________

3.1. If we had done some changes in SB and we want to update the CVS,
	then we must go to the sub-directory with the modified files, or
	on SB's main-directory.

	% cd /usr/src/cvs/SmallBASIC/sync

	or

	% cd /usr/src/cvs/SmallBASIC

3.2. So, its time for an update

	% cvs update

	The CVS will show to us the changes in the tree which will
	be done after 'commit'.

	Finaly, we update the tree by using the 'commit' parameter.

	% cvs commit

3.3. Adding or removing files

	To add or remove files in CVS tree its not automatic (by update).
	We must use the 'add' and/or 'remove' commands.

3.3.1. Adding files.

	In the directory which the our new file is located, we type:

	% cvs add my_new_file

3.3.2. Removing files

	In the directory which the file-to-be-removed is located.

	% rm deleted_file && cvs remove deleted_file

	Finaly, we must use the parameter 'commit' to update the CVS
	tree.

	% cvs commit

	Note: the -f paramters (after the 'remove' parameter) will
	remove the file automatically.

	% cvs remove -f deleted_file

Notes:

* There is need something more in SF to activate the SSL key. Really, I had
forgot it, but you can find info on SF's pages (look for ssh and/or cvs).
Please update this document.

* I am new on CVS. Maybe there are more better ways to use it, or maybe there
are missing feautures which must be mention on this document.
Please update this document.

Thank you.
