<h3>Block commands</h3>
<blockquote>

<!------- BLOAD -------------------->
<h4>Load Binary File (QB comp.)</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre class="syntax">
BLOAD filespec [,address]
</pre>

<p>
Loads a specified memory-image file into memory.

<dl>
<dt>filespec
<dd>A string expression that follows OS file naming conventions; may include any device, except "KYBD:".
<dt>address
<dd>Specifies the memory address at which filespec is loaded.
	If address is not specified, the address of BSAVE is used.
</dl>
</blockquote>

<!------- BSAVE -------------------->
<h4>Save a Binary File (QB comp.)</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre class="syntax">
BSAVE filespec, address, length
</pre>

<p>
Copies a specified portion of memory to a specified file.

<dl>
<dt>filespec
<dd>A string expression that follows OS file naming conventions; may include a device name and path.
<dt>address
<dd>Specifies the address from which the memory image will be saved.
<dt>length
<dd>Specifies the number of bytes to be saved.
</dl>
</blockquote>

<!------- TLOAD -------------------->
<h4>Loads a Text File</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre class="syntax">
TLOAD filespec {INTO | , } variable [{ {AS ARRAY| AS STRING} | , type}]
</pre>

<p>
Loads a whole text-file into memory.

<dl>
<dt>filespec
<dd>A string expression that follows OS file naming conventions.
<dt>address
<dd>Specifies the memory address at which filespec is loaded.
	If address is not specified, the address of BSAVE is used.
<dt>type
<dd>It can be 0 for array or 1 for string.
    The default is to build an array from text-lines.
	The other way is to load as a string.
</dl>

<p class="note">
Notes:
<br>
In the case of 'string', the CR/LFs must be converted to Unix style which is the default.
<br><br>
In the case of 'array', the CR/LFs must removed.
</blockquote>

<!------- TSAVE -------------------->
<h4>Saves a Text File</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre class="syntax">
TSAVE filespec {FROM | ,} variable

<p>
Creates a text file and stores the contents of 'variable'.

<dl>
<dt>filespec
<dd>A string expression that follows OS file naming conventions.
<dt>variable
<dd>Data to be written.
    If the variable is an array, each element represents a text line.
</dl>

<p class="note">
Notes:
<br>
By default the carriage-return character will be not used,
except if the C library supports it (fopen(...,"wt")).

<h3>OPEN</h3>
<blockquote>

<h4>Syntax for Sequential I/O</h4>
<pre class="syntax">
OPEN filespec [FOR mode] AS #filenum [ACCESS [access]] [share]
</pre>

<h4>Syntax for Random I/O</h4>
<pre class="syntax">
OPEN filespec FOR RANDOM AS #filenum {LEN|STRUCT}=recl [ACCESS [access]] [share]
</pre>

<h4>Syntax for Simple Database</h4>

<h4>Alternative syntax</h4>
<pre class="syntax">
filenum = OPEN(filespec, modestr[, recl])

Makes a file or device available for sequential input, sequential output, random access (either input or output).
Also, it can open a simple database file.

<dl>
<dt>filespec
<dd>A string expression that follows OS file naming conventions.

<dd>A free file number (see FREEFILE).
<dt>mode
<dd>File I/O mode
	<dl>
	<dt>INPUT

<dt>access
<dd>If included, must be one of the following:
	<dl>
	<dt>READ
	<dd>File is opened for reading only.
	<dt>WRITE
	<dd>File is opened for writing only.
	<dt>READWRITE
	<dd>File is opened for both reading and writing. (this is the default)

	<dt>EXCLUSIVE
	<dd>No other process is granted either read or write access to the file.
	</dl>
<dt>recl
<dd>Sets the record length for random files.
    Also, instead of record-length, we can use a structure name.
<dt>modestr
<dd>A string which can had the following attributes:
	<dl>
	<dt>r
	<dd>Sequential input. If recl is specified then it is used for random input.
	<dt>w
	<dd>Sequential output. If recl is specified then it is used for random output.
	<dt>a
	<dd>Sequential output, beginning at current EOF. If recl is specified then it is used for random input.

<h3>CLOSE</h3>
<blockquote>

<pre class="syntax">
CLOSE #filenum
</pre>

<p>
Closes file or device.

<dl>
<dt>filenum
<dd>The file number.
</dl>

</blockquote>
<!--- =-=-=-= ---->
<h3>FREEFILE</h3>
<blockquote>

<pre class="syntax">
filenum = FREEFILE
</pre>

<p>
Returns an unused filenum.
</blockquote>
<!--- =-=-=-= ---->
<h3>EOF</h3>
<blockquote>

<pre class="syntax">

<p>
Checks for end of file. For devices, EOF returns -1 when connection is lost or the "session" (whatever) is closed.
<dl>
<dt>filenum
<dd>The number under which the file was OPENed.
</dl>

</blockquote>
<!--- =-=-=-= ---->
<h3>LOF</h3>
<blockquote>

<pre class="syntax">
n = LOF(filenum)

Returns the length of the file.
If the file is RANDOM, then returns the number of the records.
If the file is a device/driver, then returns the remaining bytes in the input buffer.

<dl>
<dt>filenum
<dd>The number under which the file was OPENed.
</dl>

</blockquote>
<!--- =-=-=-= ---->
<h3>SEEK()/LOC()</h3>
<blockquote>

<pre class="syntax">
n = SEEK(filenum)
</pre>

<p>
Returns the current position on file.
If the file is RANDOM, then returns the number of the current record starting from 0.
If the file is a device/driver, then returns the "received" bytes.
The keyword LOC() is used for compatibility with QB.

<dl>
<dt>filenum
<dd>The number under which the file was OPENed.
</dl>

</blockquote>
<!--- =-=-=-= ---->
<h3>SEEK#</h3>
<blockquote>

<pre class="syntax">
SEEK #filenum, position
</pre>

<p>
Moves the file-pointer to specified position of the file.
If the file is RANDOM, then position represents the record number.
If the file is a device/driver, then its moves the file-pointer to the next 'position' bytes.

<dl>
<dt>filenum
<dd>The number under which the file was OPENed.
<dt>position
<dd>Position in the file.
</dl>

</blockquote>
<!--- =-=-=-= ---->
<h3>Sequential I/O</h3>
<blockquote>

<h4>Get Input from Sequential File or Device</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre class="syntax">
INPUT #filenum, variable [,variable]...
</pre>

<p>
Receives input from a sequential file or device and assigns it to one or more numeric or string variables.

<dl>
<dt>filenum
<dd>The number under which the input file was OPENed. It may refer to a disk file, a other-device file.
<dt>variable
<dd>The name of a variable (string or numeric) that will receive input.
</dl>

<p class="note">
Notes:
<br>
String input need not be enclosed within quote marks, unless it contains one or more line feeds or a
double quote mark or comma.
<br><br>
When receiving input, BASIC looks for the first character other than a space, line feed, or carriage
return. If that character is a quote mark, BASIC considers the string to be everything from the character
following the quote mark up to the next quote mark. If the first character is not a quote mark, BASIC terminates
the string when it encounters a line feed, a comma or when it has received 1024 characters.
<br><br>
For compatibility between Unix and DOS systems. Carriage return character must be ignored.
</blockquote>

<!--- LINPUT --->
<h4>Read Line from File, Ignoring Delimiters</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre class="syntax">
LINE INPUT # filenum, stringvar
</pre>

<p>
Assigns a line of input (up to 1024 characters) from a sequential file or device to a string variable.

<dl>
<dt>filenum
<dd>The number under which the file was opened.
<dt>stringvar
<dd>The name of a string variable that will receive input.
</dl>

<p class="note">
Notes:
<br>
LINE INPUT # treats all commas and quote marks as part of the input string. Input is terminated by a line-feed
(the line feed are included in the string variable assignment).
<br><br>
For compatibility between Unix and DOS systems. Carriage return character must be ignored.
</blockquote>

<!-- PRINT/WRITE -->
<h4>Output to Sequential File (QB comp.)</h4>

<blockquote>
<pre class="syntax">
PRINT #filenum; var [...]
</pre>

<p>
Writes one or more expressions. Same as screens output.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<pre class="syntax">
WRITE #filenum; var [...]
</pre>

<p>
Writes one or more expressions.

<dl>
<dt>var
<dd>BASIC outputs a line feed at the end of the list.
    If no items are included, a blank line is written.
</dl>

<p class="note">
Notes:
<br>
WRITE# differs from PRINT# in the following ways:
<br>
* The data items (at disk) are separated by a comma.
<br>
* The String expressions are output enclosed in double-quote marks.

<h3>Random I/O</h3>
<blockquote>

<h4>Set Record Structure (Optional)</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre class="syntax">
STRUCT name; { field=[type]len [, ...] | array }
</pre>

<p>
Setting structure of record for the file 'filenum'.
Because we want to use the same commands for databases,
this command uses extented syntax.

<dl>
<dt>name
<dd>a name for the structure
<dt>field
<dd>The name of the field.
    Field names are following the same rules as the variable names.
<dt>type
<dd>Field type can be one of the following
    <dl>
	<dt>C
	<dd>String
	<dt>N or R
	<dd>Real number
	<dt>I
	<dd>Integer (32bit or bigger)
	<dt>D
	<dd>Date
	<dt>M
	<dd>Memo (same as C but in some drivers may be needed for big-length fields)
	<dt>B
	<dd>Boolean
	</dl>
<dt>len
<dd>The size of the field
</dl>

<p>
When an array is used instead of fields, each element is a field description.
Each field description had two elements, the first is the name and the second is the len (with or without the type).

<p>
Structure variables must be applied on strings too.

<pre class="example">
REM A Structure
STRUCT myrec; ID=4, NAME=32, PHONE=12
h = OPEN("my.db", "r", myrec)
' while
WHILE !EOF(h)
	IF FLD(h, "name") = "NDC" THEN PUT #f; "name" = "Nicholas"
	NEXT #h
WEND
' for
FOR i = 0 TO LOF(h)-1
	IF FLD(h, i, "name") = "NDC" THEN PUT #h; "name" = "Nicholas"
NEXT
' for #2
FOR i = 0 TO LOF(h)-1
	r = REC(h, i)
	IF r(1) = "NDC" THEN r(1) = "Nicholas" : PUT #h; r
NEXT
'
CLOSE #h
</pre>

</blockquote>

<h4>Get Input from Random File or Device</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre class="syntax">
variable = REC(filenum[, index])
</pre>

<p>
Returns the data of the 'index' record. If 'index' is omitted then the current record (SEEK)
is used. If record contains more than one field then an array is returned.
</blockquote>

<h4>Writes to Random File or Device</h4>
<blockquote>

<pre class="syntax">
PUT #filenum; [index,] field=var [, field=var [...]]
</pre>

<pre class="syntax">
PUT #filenum; [index,] array
</pre>

<p>
Writes the data on the 'index' record.
If 'index' is omitted then the current record (SEEK) is used.
If record does not exists it creates one.
If the 'index' is biggest than the number of records, then blank records will be inserted.

<dt>CONTACT:[category/]name
<dd>Contacts database.
    On PalmOS this is the address book,
	on Linux the KAddressBook,
	on Windows the Address book of Outlook express.
	If there is no a standard address book, then a database file is used.
</dl>

<h3>PDOC emulation driver</h3>

<dl>
<dt>PDOC:file
<dd>Compressed PalmOS Documents.
    If the basic file-stream module it is works then there is no need for more coding.
</dl>

<h3>GZIP emulation driver</h3>

<dl>
<dt>GZIP:file
<dd>Compressed files using zlib.
    If the basic file-stream module it is works and the zlib exists then there is no need for more coding.
	If there is no such library, then, a PDOC can be used as a temporary replacement.
