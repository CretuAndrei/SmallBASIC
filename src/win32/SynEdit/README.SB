I had to patch it for 
    Borland C++ Builder 6

---
Installation

1. Because I did a stupid thing...
	*.dcr and *.dfm files are not binaries :-Z
	You can get that from synedit.sf.net, package ver 1.1
	Replace those files with originals.

2. Load with BCB
	...\sbrs3\sync\win32\SynEdit\Packages\SynEdit_BCB6.bpk

3. Use 'Install' option of the package windows

You must be ready...
