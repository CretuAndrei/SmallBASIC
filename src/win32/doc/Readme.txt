Installation:
-------------

Create a directory (ex: c:\sbwin)

Extract the zip file on that directory


Win32 version, notes:
---------------------

* The RUN() function is working only for command-line programs.

* The RUN() results may be not be printed correctly.

* TICKSPERSEC() value it is fake.

* Capture... captures ascii output of the program.
	CLS clears the whole buffer.

* Win9x/ME. The 'capture' control can hold up to 64kB.

* If SB freezes sometimes, disable MM sound from settings
	Without MMSound, sounds (not background) can be heard by Speaker!
	Anyway on Win9x/ME this is completly useless since Beep() does not supported.

The 'editor' is the open-source component 'synedit'
