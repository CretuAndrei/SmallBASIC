- Add command argument GUI for fltk to allow run time args to be set.
  usefull when creating command line based applications.
- Add option to FLTK version to support run once and then terminate
- replace keywords.txt with internal buffer (FLTK)
- Add break point, variable inspection, step/resume options.
