       * added support for func/sub pointer variables used with the call statement:
	func foo(s)
         foo="foo!"+s
       end
       sub bar
         ? "in bar"
       end
       p = @foo
       ? call(@foo, "#")
       ? call(p, "%")
       pb = @bar
       call pb
       call @bar
 
       * USRCALL has been removed since it never worked and the above
 	is a better replacement (IMHO)

	* updated chain command to take string or array	of string arguments in

	memory routines with simple malloc/free calls
	* added GRID+TAB button support to GTK build

  usefull when creating command line based applications
- Add option to FLTK version to support run once and then terminate
- replace keywords.txt with internal buffer	
- Add break point, variable inspection, step/resume options. line
  number byte-code generation to depend on user option (FLTK)
